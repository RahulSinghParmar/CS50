## Introduction to Game Development

## **Welcome**

This course picks up where [CS50x](CS50X%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%200c3dc256fd064730a562642fb9d80705.md) leaves off, focusing on the development of 2D and 3D interactive games. Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Portal in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as languages like Lua and C#. By class’s end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

**Prerequisites**[CS50x](CS50X%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%200c3dc256fd064730a562642fb9d80705.md) or prior experience in any programming language.
