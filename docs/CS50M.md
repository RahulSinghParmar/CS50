## Mobile App Development with React Native

## **Welcome**

This course picks up where [CS50x](CS50X%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%200c3dc256fd064730a562642fb9d80705.md) leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native, a popular open-source framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript without Java or Swift. The course introduces students to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, students gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which students implement an app entirely of their own design.

**Prerequisites**[CS50x](CS50X%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%200c3dc256fd064730a562642fb9d80705.md) or equivalent as well as a strong background with HTML and CSS and comfort with basic JavaScript.
